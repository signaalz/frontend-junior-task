# Front-end Challenge: Job Application Form with Next.js, Tailwind CSS

Create a simple job application form using Next.js, styled with Tailwind CSS. This task should be completable within a week (can be done in a day)

## Requirements

   - Skills (multi-select with at least 5 options)
   - Cover letter (text area)

4. **Form Validation**: Implement basic form validation (required fields, email format).

5. **Submission Handling**: On form submission, display the submitted data in a formatted view below the form.
